WebApp for smiley-homes.at
v.0.0

The idea of this WebApp is to take the content from a Joomla! throught a Web-Service component, 
	parse into a JSON object and bind the content with knockout.

The first commit is only HTML content

I'm using JQuery UI. It's my first time, so a litte bit patient ;-)
